# From the original author:
This is a small game written in C. <br />
Your task is to collect all the apples while avoiding enemies. <br />
I do not recommend using the source code for learning C.
I wrote this game just for fun :)
Have a good game!

## Movement:<br />
 Arrows - move <br />
 Space - shot <br />
 q - open menu <br />

## Screenshots

# Compiling
You must have acurses (included in the src directory) and AgDev C installed.

# Notes
The redraw isn't very quick so the flickering is quite heavy. The non-blocking keyboard routines do not behave well.
